Installation on a fresh machine :

apt install doxygen, python3-sphinx

optionally, the RTD theme : pip install sphinx_rtd_theme

pip install breathe==4.13.0 => breathe is a bridge between doxygen and sphinx. I've used 4.13.0 version

Make sure the add sphinx related command to path.


1. Create source files + CMakeLists, etc.

2. mkdir docs => cd docs => doxygen -g (to make the Doxyfile)

3. Inside the generate Doxyfile, find the INPUT variable and point it to INPUT = ../src (or your source file location)
3b. You might want to install sudo apt install graphviz to make dot dependency happy.


cd docs/
sphinx-quickstart (only once)
make html

mkdir api (or whatever) to have subfolders.

Limitations : cannot directly link to source files.
